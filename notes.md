# Notes 


## 10/10/2024
So theres a few things that I noticed needs to be changed. I already started on somethings such as readme implementation. But it's very incomplete and overall nonfunctional. 

I need to implement : 
- [ ] README signature recognition, find the signature and then modify the file accordingly without destroying the rest of the file.
- [ ] Fix relative pathing for the README.md file. (currently it outputs everything literally to the path specified in the arguments ex: `cgdoc ../src/ --> (file)[../src/file.h]`)
- [ ] Implement a way to get the file name, this probably will have to be a void pointer to a struct.
